# R Notes
This repository is a collection of R code that I've written while taking online courses and working on small projects looking at interesting data sets and exploring relationships and trends. 

This is not the full extent of my R coding, but rather the code that I have had the time to write up separately way from projects.

Check my [Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/willcanniford) for more examples of more complete projects with analysis and visualisations of different data sets.
