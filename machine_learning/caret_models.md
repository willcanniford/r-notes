Building and comparing models with `caret`
================

`caret` is an immensely powerful
[package](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) for R which allows
for the control of training parameters, reproducible model comparison,
quick model comparison, tuning of hyperparameters and preprocessing of
data, among others.

Iâ€™ve had a fair bit of experience building models with it, and trying to
learn the best practices of machine learning and model building. Those
projects can primarily be found on my [Kaggle
profile](https://www.kaggle.com/willcanniford), or there is some record
of them here on [my github](https://github.com/willcanniford/kaggle).
